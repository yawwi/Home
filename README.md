### History Of Rice Writting

Rice writting is the art, skill, and talent of being able to write small enough to fit your writting on a Grain Of Rice. The artisans would either write a small message or write names on the grain of rice. Rice art is considered good luck, most popular in a form of a necklace, key chain, and bracelets.
